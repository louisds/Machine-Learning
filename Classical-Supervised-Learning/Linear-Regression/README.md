# Linear Regression

## Introduction

Linear regression is a parametric statistical modeling technique used to establish the relationship between a continuous dependent variable (response variable $Y \in \mathbb{R}$) and one or more independent variables (Predictors $**X** X \in \mathbb{R}^p$):

$$
Y = f(**X**) + \varepsilon
$$


It is a widely used method for analyzing and modeling quantitative data, and it has applications in fields such as finance, economics, social sciences, and engineering.

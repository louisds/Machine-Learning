# Linear Regression

## Introduction

Linear regression is a parametric statistical modeling technique used to establish the relationship between a continuous dependent variable (response variable $Y \in \mathbf{R}$) and one or more independent variables (Predictors $X = (X_{1}, X_{2}, ..., X_{p})$). 


It is a widely used method for analyzing and modeling quantitative data, and it has applications in fields such as finance, economics, social sciences, and engineering.

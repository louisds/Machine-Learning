# Logistic Regression and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

Logistic Regression is one of the most basic Machine Learning algorithms for classification tasks (e.g. spam detection). It models the relationship between a categorical response variable ($Y$) and one or more predictor variables ($X$). Based on the number and data type of the classes, there are different forms of logistic regression:



1. `Binary Logistic Regression`: The target variable has two possible categorical values (e.g. spam vs. no spam).

2. `Multinomial Logistic Regression`: The target variable has three or more possible categorical outcomes (e.g. handwritten digit classifier).

3. `Ordinal Logistic Regression`: The target categorical variables are ordered (e.g. satisfaction ratings).
